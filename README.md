# Tisserin

Tisserin or Tisserin Design System (TDS) is a system to help designers, programmer/developpers, etc. to design and write content for governements, societies, companies, entreprises. Tisserin can also be used for personal or profesional projects following some rules such as accessibility to make everybody gain access to the designed and written content.

Some principles we based on to build our design system are:

**positioning**: (in English, * Search Engine Optimization - SEO *): set of techniques allowing a site to appear in the best possible position in the results pages of search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing. This step is done from the design phase and during the writing of the code (development).

**Referencing**: action of notifying the existence of a site to search engines or internet directories

**Accessibility**: set of techniques implemented during the design and development to allow consultation of a site (access to this site) by a disabled person using an adapted reading terminal (braille keyboard, reader screen, etc.)
